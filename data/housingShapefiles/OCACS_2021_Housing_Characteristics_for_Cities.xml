            <abstract>US Census American Community Survey (ACS) 2021, 5-year estimates of the key housing characteristics of Cities/Places geographic level in Orange County, California. The data contains 406 fields for the variable groups H01: Housing occupancy (universe: total housing units, table X25, 3 fields); H02: Units in structure (universe: total housing units, table X25, 11 fields); H03: Population in occupied housing units by tenure by units in structure (universe: total population in occupied housing units, table X25, 13 fields); H04: Year structure built (universe: total housing units, table X25, 15 fields); H05: Rooms (universe: total housing units, table X25, 18 fields); H06: Bedrooms (universe: total housing units, table X25, 21 fields); H07: Housing tenure by race of householder (universe: occupied housing units, table X25, 51 fields); H08: Total population in occupied housing units by tenure (universe: total population in occupied housing units, table X25, 3 fields); H09: Vacancy status (universe: vacant housing units, table X25, 8 fields); H10: Occupied housing units by race of householder (universe: occupied housing units, table X25, 8 fields); H11: Year householder moved into unit (universe: occupied housing units, table X25, 18 fields); H12: Vehicles available (universe: occupied housing units, table X25, 18 fields); H13: Housing heating fuel (universe: occupied housing units, table X25, 10 fields); H14: Selected housing characteristics (universe: occupied housing units, table X25, 9 fields); H15: Occupants per room (universe: occupied housing units, table X25, 13 fields); H16: Housing value (universe: owner-occupied units, table X25, 32 fields); H17: Price asked for vacant for sale only, and sold not occupied housing units (universe: vacant for sale only, and sold not occupied housing units, table X25, 28 fields); H18: Mortgage status (universe: owner-occupied units, table X25, 10 fields); H19: Selected monthly owner costs, SMOC (universe: owner-occupied housing units with or without a mortgage, table X25, 45 fields); H20: Selected monthly owner costs as a percentage of household income, SMOCAPI (universe: owner-occupied housing units with or without a mortgage, table X25, 26 fields); H21: Contract rent distribution and rent asked distribution in dollars (universe: renter-occupied housing units paying cash rent and vacant, for rent, and rented not occupied housing units, table X25, 7 fields); H22: Gross rent (universe: occupied units paying rent, table X25, 28 fields), and; X23: Gross rent as percentage of household income (universe: occupied units paying rent, table X25, 11 fields). The US Census geodemographic data are based on the 2021 TigerLines across multiple geographies. The spatial geographies were merged with ACS data tables.
